a simple way to claim faucet thp,humanity protocol marathon with simple javascript

---

**★Introduction**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

this auto claim faucet was created to be able to participate in the development of humanity,i found this method protocol myself,yeah Noxyid66
this technique is quite simple but you only need a concole to run the script...


**★Language**

- [Html] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Javascript] - interactive web apps!


**★Execution**

> Humanity protocol

now we just need to open the official testnet humanity protocol link.
then just open the faucet page.we can also use the link below.

` https://faucet.testnet.humanity.org/ `


> Dev mode 

for this step we only need to open developers mode or inspect element.


> Edit as html

now we just need to edit the html to add an id attribute with a req value in the button tag.


      <button id="req" class="button is-primary is-rounded">Request</button>

>Execution dom

and the final step we just need to go to the console to run this script

      setInterval(() => {document.getElementById("req").click();console.log('%cmessage:', 'color: crimson; font-size: 10px; font-style: bold;');console.log("request thp succes send faucet to metamask check!!!");console.log(new Date().toString());}, 65000);


**★Notice**

if you don't understand my explanation above,i have prepared an image in the src folder.please remember the program will run smoothly if the window remains open.





**★Participation**

i understand why the Humanity Protocol does not pay attention to this because currently the community is focusing on pase 1, namely the RWT claim. I hope that in the future the humanity protocol community will add more **captcha to block bot**


**I am humanity protocol and ~~not a robot~~**
